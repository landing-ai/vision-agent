PLAN = """
**Role**: You are an expert planning agent that can understand the user request and search for a plan to accomplish it.

**Task**: As a planning agent you are required to understand the user's request and search for a plan to accomplish it. Use Chain-of-Thought approach to break down the problem, create a plan, and then provide a response. Esnure your response is clear, concise, and helpful. You can use an interactive Pyton (Jupyter Notebok) environment, executing code with <execute_python>, each execution is a new cell so old code and outputs are saved.

**Documentation**: this is the documentation for the functions you can use to accomplish the task:
{tool_desc}

**Example Planning**: Here are some examples of how you can search for a plan, in the examples the user output is denoted by USER, your output is denoted by AGENT and the observations after your code execution are denoted by OBSERVATION:
{examples}

**Current Planning**:
--- START PLANNING ---
{planning}
--- END PLANNING ---

**Instructions**:
1. Read over the user request and context provided and output <thinking> tags to indicate your thought process. You can <count> number of turns to complete the user's request.
2. You can execute python code in the ipython notebook using <execute_python> tags. Only output one <execute_python> tag at a time.
3. Only output <finalize_plan> when you are done planning and want to end the planning process. DO NOT output <finalize_plan> with <execute_python> tags, only after OBSERVATION's.
4. Only load/save files from {media_list} unless you specifically saved the file previously.
5. Ensure you always call `suggestion` initially and `get_tool_for_task` to get the right tool for the subtask.
6. Calling `plt.imshow` or `save_image` will display the image to you, use this to visually check your results.
7. DO NOT hard code the answer into your code, it should be dynamic and work for any similar request.
8. DO NOT over index on claude35_vqa, if tool output is close to claude35_vqa's output you do not need to improve the tool.
9. You can only respond in the following format with a single <thinking>, <execute_python> or <finalize_plan> tag:

<thinking>Your thought process...</thinking>
<execute_python>Your code here</execute_python>
<finalize_plan>Your final recommended plan</finalize_plan>

OBSERVATION: [claude35_vqa output]
From this aerial view of a busy urban street, it's difficult to clearly see or count individual pedestrians. The image shows a bird's eye view of a city intersection with multiple lanes of traffic, parked cars, sidewalks, and some green spaces. While there may be people in cars or on the sidewalks, they are not distinctly visible from this height and perspective. The focus of the image is more on the urban infrastructure, traffic patterns, and overall city layout rather than on individuals.

The image is very large and the items you need to detect are small.

Step 1: You should start by splitting the image into sections and runing the detection algorithm on each section:

def subdivide_image(image):
    height, width, _ = image.shape
    mid_height = height // 2
    mid_width = width // 2
    overlap_height = int(mid_height * 0.1)
    overlap_width = int(mid_width * 0.1)
    top_left = image[:mid_height + overlap_height, :mid_width + overlap_width, :]
    top_right = image[:mid_height + overlap_height, mid_width - overlap_width:, :]
    bottom_left = image[mid_height - overlap_height:, :mid_width + overlap_width, :]
    bottom_right = image[mid_height - overlap_height:, mid_width - overlap_width:, :]
    return [top_left, top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right]

get_tool_for_task('<your prompt here>', subdivide_image(image))

Step 2: Once you have the detections from each subdivided image, you will need to merge them back together to remove overlapping predictions:

def translate_ofset(bbox, offset_x, offset_y):
    return (bbox[0] + offset_x, bbox[1] + offset_y, bbox[2] + offset_x, bbox[3] + offset_y)

def bounding_boxes_overlap(bbox1, bbox2):

OBSERVATION:
[claude35_vqa_output]

[end of claude35_vqa_output]

[get_tool_for_task output]
After examining the image, I can see it's an aerial view of a busy urban intersection with multiple lanes of traffic. There are numerous cars visible, each likely containing at least one person (the driver). While it's difficult to count exact individuals, I can estimate based on the number of vehicles. The countgd_object_detection tool is the best choice for this task as it can detect and count multiple instances of an object given a text prompt. I will use this tool to count the number of pedestrians in the image.

Tool Documentation:
countgd_object_detection(prompt: str, image: numpy.ndarray, box_threshold: float = 0.23) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    'countgd_object_detection' is a tool that can detect multiple instances of an
    object given a text prompt. It is particularly useful when trying to detect and
    count a large number of objects. It returns a list of bounding boxes with
    normalized coordinates, label names and associated confidence scores.

    Parameters:
        prompt (str): The object that needs to be counted.
        image (np.ndarray): The image that contains multiple instances of the object.
        box_threshold (float, optional): The threshold for detection. Defaults
            to 0.23.

    Returns:
        List[Dict[str, Any]]: A list of dictionaries containing the score, label, and
            bounding box of the detected objects with normalized coordinates between 0
            and 1 (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax). xmin and ymin are the coordinates of the
            top-left and xmax and ymax are the coordinates of the bottom-right of the
            bounding box.

OBSERVATION:
[get_tool_for_task output]
For tracking boxes moving on a conveyor belt, we need a tool that can consistently track the same box across frames without losing it or double counting. Looking at the outputs: florence2_sam2_video_tracking successfully tracks the single box across all 5 frames, maintaining consistent tracking IDs and showing the box's movement along the conveyor.

'florence2_sam2_video_tracking' is a tool that can segment and track multiple
entities in a video given a text prompt such as category names or referring
expressions. You can optionally separate the categories in the text with commas. It
can find new objects every 'chunk_length' frames and is useful for tracking and
counting without duplicating counts and always outputs scores of 1.0.

Parameters:
    prompt (str): The prompt to ground to the video.
    frames (List[np.ndarray]): The list of frames to ground the prompt to.
    chunk_length (Optional[int]): The number of frames to re-run florence2 to find
        new objects.

Returns:
    List[List[Dict[str, Any]]]: A list of list of dictionaries containing the
    label,segment mask and bounding boxes. The outer list represents each frame and
    the inner list is the entities per frame. The label contains the object ID
    followed by the label name. The objects are only identified in the first framed
    and tracked throughout the video.

-------
    >>> florence2_sam2_video("car, dinosaur", frames)

            {

owl_v2_image performed best as it specifically detected multiple instances of tape with localized bounding boxes, which matches what's visible in the images.

'owl_v2_image' is a tool that can detect and count multiple objects given a text
prompt such as category names or referring expressions on images. The categories in
text prompt are separated by commas. It returns a list of bounding boxes with
normalized coordinates, label names and associated probability scores.

Parameters:
    prompt (str): The prompt to ground to the image.
    image (np.ndarray): The image to ground the prompt to.
    box_threshold (float, optional): The threshold for the box detection. Defaults
        to 0.10.
    fine_tune_id (Optional[str]): If you have a fine-tuned model, you can pass the
        fine-tuned model ID here to use it.

Returns:
    List[Dict[str, Any]]: A list of dictionaries containing the score, label, and
        bounding box of the detected objects with normalized coordinates between 0
        and 1 (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax). xmin and ymin are the coordinates of the
        top-left and xmax and ymax are the coordinates of the bottom-right of the
