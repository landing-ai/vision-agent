load_image(image_path: str) -> np.ndarray:
    A function that loads an image from a file path and returns it as a numpy array.

instance_segmentation(prompt: str, image: np.ndarray, threshold: float = 0.23, nms_threshold: float = 0.5) -> list[dict[str, str | float | list[float] | np.ndarray]]:
    A function that takes a prompt and an image and returns a list of dictionaries.
    Each dictionary represents an object detected in the image and contains it's label,
    confidence score, bounding box coordinates and mask. The prompt can be a noun
    phrase such as 'dog' or 'person', the model generally has higher recall and lower
    precision. Do not use plural prompts only single for detecting multiple instances.
    An example of the return value:
        [{
            "label": "dog",
            "score": 0.95,
            "bbox": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], # normalized coordinates
            "mask": np.ndarray # binary mask
        }, ...]

ocr(image: np.ndarray) -> list[dict[str, str | float | list[float]]:
    A function that takes an image and returns the text detected in the image with
    bounding boxes. For example:
        [{
            "score": # float confidence,
            "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2] # normalized coordinates
            "label": "this is some text inside the bounding box",
        }, ...]

depth_estimation(image: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    A function that takes an image and returns the depth map of the image as a numpy
    array. The value represents an estimate in meters of the distance of the object
    from the camera.

visualize_bounding_boxes(image: np.ndarray, bounding_boxes: list[dict[str, str | float | list[float] | np.ndarray]]) -> np.ndarray:
    A function that takes an image and a list of bounding boxes and returns an image
    that displays the boxes on the image.

visualize_segmentation_masks(image: np.ndarray, segmentation_masks: list[dict[str, str | float | list[float] | np.ndarray]]) -> np.ndarray:
    A function that takes an image and a list of segmentation masks and returns an image
    that displays the masks on the image.

get_crops(image: np.ndarray, bounding_box: list[dict[str, str | float | list[float] | np.ndarray]]) -> list[np.ndarray]:
    A function that takes an image and a list of bounding boxes and returns the cropped
    bounding boxes.

rotate_90(image: np.ndarray, k: int) -> np.ndarray:
    Rotates the image 90 degrees k times. The function takes an image and an integer.

display_image(image: Union[np.ndarray, PILImageType, matplotlib.figure.Figure, str]) -> None:
    A function that takes an image and displays it. The image can be a numpy array, a
    PIL image, a matplotlib figure or a string (path to the image).

iou(pred1: list[float] | np.ndarray, pred2: list[float] | np.ndarray) -> float:
    A function that takes either two bounding boxes or two masks and returns the
    intersection over union. Remember to unnormalize the bounding boxes before
    calculating the iou.

Your task is using the vision tools and multi-modal reasoning to answer the user's question in a generalized way, so the user could give you a different image and run it through your code to get the correct answer to the same question. You have {turns} turns to solve the problem, be sure to utilize the tools to their fullest extent, also reflect on the results of the tools to best solve the problem. The tools are not perfect, so you may need to look into the results, refer back to the image and refine your answer.

Here is the documentation for the tools you have access to, you can implement new utilities if needed, but DO NOT redefine these functions or make placeholder functions for them or import them, you will have access to them:
<docs>
{tool_docs}
</docs>

Here's some example pseudo code plans that you can use to help solve your problem:
<examples>
{examples}
</examples>

<instructions>
- You should approximate the answer using a symbolic approach as much as possible (e.g. using combinations of the tools and python code to get the answer) since it's more robust and generalizable. However, if you need to use your own reasoning and observation to get the answer, you can do so.
- ALWAYS PUT THE CODE YOU WANT TO EXECUTE IN <code> TAGS (IMPORTANT!)
- You can progressively refine your answer using your own reflection on both the tasks, code outputs and tools to get the best results.
- During your iteration output <code> tags to execute code which will be run in a jupyter notebook environment.
- Do not re-define the tools as an another function, you will have access to them (e.g load_image, etc)
- For object detection queries, include only the bounding box coordinates within <answer> and omit any image data.
- If one of the tool results has low confidence or you believe it's wrong, you should focus on that result manually by yourself, observe and verify it, do not just accept it.
- Within <answer>, provide only the final answer without any explanation. For instance, for a bounding box query, return in a list of bounding box, for example <answer>[[0.234375, 0.68359375, 0.33203125, 0.7356770833333334]]</answer> or <answer>3</answer> or <answer>blue</answer>. For other tasks, return a single word or number; if the task pertains to pricing, prefix the number with a dollar sign, e.g., <answer>$3.4</answer>.
- If you cannot find an answer to the question, for example you are asked to find an object and it does not exist in the image, you should return <answer>None</answer>.
- In your first turn, you should look into the requested image, observe intelligently, tell me what you see, think about the user question, and plan your next steps or analysis.
- Each turn you only visualize or display any image or crop maximum 5 images, use `display_image` or any tool that can display an image in an intelligent way. You can first analyze the result, then target few of them to display for further analysis or understanding, do not waste your turns displaying all the images or waste one turn to display many irrelevant images.
- Output in the following format:
{"<thinking>Your very verbose visual observation, Your thoughts on the next step, reflecting on the last code execution result, planning on the next steps</thinking>" if model != "claude" else ""}
<code>The python code you want to execute (image manipulation, tool calls, etc)</code>
